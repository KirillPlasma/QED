    <LI> Welcome to QED, a short interactive text in <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus" target="_blank">propositional logic</A> arranged in the format of a computer game.  </LI>
    <LI> Propositional logic is the logic of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_sentence" target="_blank">atomic propositions</A> (which in this text are given names such as <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, or <I>C</I>) and the statements one can form from these propositions using logical connectives such as AND, OR, and IMPLIES.  It is a subset of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic" target="_blank">first-order logic</A>, which is the main form of logic used in mathematics. </LI>
    <LI> The objective of this "game" is to prove statements in propositional logic from the given hypotheses by clicking and dragging on statements that one has already deduced.  By solving exercises in this game, you should develop a greater understanding of propositional logic.</LI>
    <LI> Expand the "Sections and exercises" section above and then click on the "Exercise 1.1" button to begin the text and start the sequence of exercises!</LI>

If the text has updated to a new version since your last session, you may need to reset the text in order for it to work correctly, or at least redo some of the exercises that unlock certain laws.  This page works best when viewed on a large screen and with the ability to drag-and-drop; in particular, this page is unlikely to be all that functional on a cell phone.  Also one may need a recently updated browser in order for the page to work properly (in particular, grid layouts and local storage should be supported for the best experience).
